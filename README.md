# PrepPal
Exam Revision Tool built in Palantir AIP for their Palantir Winter Tech Fellowship programme.

My project, PrepPal, is a revision tool designed to help students prepare for exams more efficiently. PrepPal allows users to upload study materials, such as PDFs, notes, or lecture slides, and uses the power of AIP and its integrated large language models to process the material and generate a personalised question bank. Each question comes with answers and detailed explanations, making it easier for students to test themselves and enhance their learning. The app is built in Workshop and  includes the integrated functionality to interact with a LLM through an AIP Logic Function, to explain an answer to a question in more detail.
