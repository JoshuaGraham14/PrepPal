# PrepPal: AI-Powered Revision Tool

AI-powered revision tool built in Palantir AIP for their Palantir Winter Tech Fellowship programme.

*Technologies: Palantir AIP, Large Language Models (LLMs)*  

- Developed a revision tool designed to help students prepare for exams efficiently by turning uploaded study materials into an interactive question bank.  
- Utilised **large language models** to process PDFs, notes, and lecture slides into personalised questions, complete with answers and detailed explanations, using **Ontology** to structure and manage study materials.
- Integrated functionality to interact with an LLM through an **AIP Logic Function** to generate detailed explanations for selected answers.
- Built in **AIP Workshop**, designed features for filtering questions by **lecture**, **difficulty**, and **marks**.

My project, PrepPal, is a revision tool designed to help students prepare for exams more efficiently. PrepPal allows users to upload study materials, such as PDFs, notes, or lecture slides, and uses the power of AIP and its integrated large language models (LLMs) to process the material and generate a personalised question bank. Each question comes with answers and detailed explanations, making it easier for students to test themselves and enhance their learning. The app is built in Workshop and  includes the integrated functionality to interact with a LLM through an AIP Logic Function, to explain an answer to a question in more detail.
